#Write a Go code snippet that produces the following output:

initial
1 2
true
0
apple

##Hint: Use variable declarations and fmt.Println() to print each line of the output.


#Learning that can be used as comments:
###var declares 1 or more variables.
###You can declare multiple variables at once.
###Go will infer the type of initialized variables.
###Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued. For example, the zero value for an int is 0.
###The := syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable, e.g. for var f string = "apple" in this case. This syntax is only available inside functions.
