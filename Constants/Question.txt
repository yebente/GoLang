Write a Go code snippet that produces the following output:

constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404

Hint: Use 
- n = 500000000
- fmt.Println() 
- d = 3e20 / n
- int64
- math.Sin

Learning:
- const declares a constant value (n = 500000000)
- A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can (d = 3e20 / n)
- Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.
- A numeric constant has no type until itâ€™s given one, such as by an explicit conversion.
- A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here math.Sin expects a float64.
