Write a Go code snippet that produces the following output:

constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404

Hint: Use constant declarations with const and fmt.Println() to print each line of the output.

Learning:
- const declares a constant value.
- A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can.
- Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.
- A numeric constant has no type until itâ€™s given one, such as by an explicit conversion.
- A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here math.Sin expects a float64.
